## Improvement Ideas

With more time given to this project, I would consider the following ideas and features.

- Bring in Framer Motion for tasteful animations that add delight
- Add a users table secured with a user authentication strategy and data access controls
- Break out code into small commits and use PRs to explain intention
- Update message timestamps (`created` field) on an interval so that UI updates without interaction
- Use TanStack Query for fetching on window focus and add polling interval
- Add ability to edit messages
- Better error handling with toast messages
- ...others
<!-- - Extend the API -->

## Findings

### Cross-origin Resource Sharing (CORS)

I needed to add the express `cors` middleware in order to allow the frontend running at `http://localhost:3000` to communicate with the backend at `http://localhost:3001`.

## Considerations

### Framework

When thinking about this craft assignment, I considered using a full-stack framework with which I am comfortable working. For me, that is Next.js. However, the testing story for end-to-end tests is still a work in progress, so I stuck with a React frontend and an Express.js backend.
